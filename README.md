# About me

- I'm currently working at Entidad Binacional Yacyreta on an administrative position and some sort of data analysis.
- I'm on a journey to learn coding independently, to hopefully find a place to work that suits best with the type of person i am.
- I want to solve problems and come up with ideas to help people, as well as making a living while enjoying it.
- I'm looking forward to be part of this and to learn, a lot.
